# Markopolo.ai-Intern-Assesment-Project
This project is part of the internship assessment for Markopolo.ai. The goal of this assessment is to analyze and gain insights from the Wine Quality dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


# Dataset
The dataset used for this assessment is the Wine Quality dataset, which consists of two separate datasets: one for red wine and another for white wine. The dataset includes various physicochemical properties of the wines, such as acidity levels, residual sugar, chlorides, and more. The quality of the wines is rated on a scale from 1 to 10.


# Notebooks
In this repository, you will find two Colab notebook files:

Intern assesment(winequality-red).ipynb: This notebook focuses on analyzing and visualizing the characteristics and quality of red wines.
Intern assesment(winequality-white).ipynb: This notebook focuses on analyzing and visualizing the characteristics and quality of white wines.


# How to run
To run the notebooks, you need to just click on "Open in Colab". Besides you can download these notebooks and run them in Jupyter Notebook or Pycharm.
